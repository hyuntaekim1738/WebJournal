Follow these instructions to begin collaborating.
1. Once you have shared GitHub, google, Spotify, and MongoDB accounts, clone the repo
2. Run command " cd web-journal "
3. Run " npm install "
4. Run command " touch .env.local "
5. Open the .env.local file and copy/paste the 5 lines below into the file
MONGODB_URI=
GOOGLE_ID=
GOOGLE_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLOUD_BUCKET_NAME=
GOOGLE_CLOUD_CREDENTIALS=
GOOGLE_AI_KEY=
6. Go to MongoDB Atlas and navigate to the project "WebJournal".
    On the side there should be a tab that says "Database Access".
    You should have been given a Mongo User by me.
    Then go to the "Clusters" tab, select the "Connect" button, select the 
    "Drivers" option, and copy paste the connection string into the .env.local file
    at MONGODB_URI=<connection_string>. Replace the <db_username>:<db_password> in the string
    with the user that I sent in the discord.
7. Go to console.cloud.google.com, select the "WebJournal" project, and search "OAuth". 
    Select the option that says "Credentials". Under "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs", click "Web client 1".
    Under the "Additional Information" pane, copy paste the Client ID into GOOGLE_ID=<client_id> on .env.local,
    copy paste the client secret into GOOGLE_SECRET=<client_secret>.
8. Create a Service Account Key
    - On google cloud console, navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts
    - Locate or create a service account (e.g., `entry-uploader`)
    - Click "Keys" > "Add Key" > "Create new key"
    - Select JSON, click Create, and save the file somewhere safe
    - Copy paste the JSON file into GOOGLE_CLOUD_CREDENTIALS=<json_file_output>, make sure that the 
        output of the file is all consolidated into ONE LINE 
9. Copy paste the google cloud porject ID into GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=<project_id>
10. Navigate to storage on google cloud, select the bucket and copy paste its name into GOOGLE_CLOUD_BUCKET_NAME=<bucket_name>
12. Get the google gemini API key and copy paste it into GOOGLE_AI_KEY=<api+key>
11. Run command " openssl rand -base64 32 ". Copy paste the terminal output into the .env.local file 
    in NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<output>.
12. Go to spotify development, select webJournal and copy paste the client ID and client secret into corresponding fields 
    of .env.local
13. Make sure you are in the web-journal directory. Run " npm run dev ".
14. Go to GitHub, assign to yourself the issue you'd like to work on, create and checkout the corresponding branch, and code.
